# 🛒 Amazon Homepage Clone (HTML/CSS/JS)

This project is a static front-end clone of the Amazon product listing page. It primarily focuses on replicating the layout, styling, and visual elements of the site using **HTML** and **CSS**. The design demonstrates proficiency in basic web development and layout principles, including a responsive structure (implied by CSS Grid usage).

## ✨ Features

* **Header Navigation:** Replicates the persistent top navigation bar with the Amazon logo, search bar, "Returns & Orders," and cart icon.
* **Product Grid:** Displays a grid of sample products, complete with images, descriptions, rating icons, review counts, price, and quantity selection dropdowns.
* **Styling:** Uses pure CSS for custom styling of buttons, links, and the overall layout.
* **CSS Grid Layout:** Uses the `display: grid` property for arranging the product cards on the page.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **HTML5** (Structure)
* **CSS3** (Styling)
* **JavaScript** (For basic functionality, e.g., cart quantity update)

### Prerequisites

You need a modern web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge) and a text editor or IDE.

### Installation and Viewing

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    cd Amazon-Homepage-Clone-HTML-CSS-JS
    ```
2.  **Access the Code:**
    * **IMPORTANT:** To properly view and modify the code, you should open the project folder directly with an IDE like **VS Code** or another compatible code editor.
    * Ensure the **`Amazon.html`** file and the **`images`** folder are present together in the same directory. **The product images and icons are stored in the `images` folder, and the HTML file must be able to access them for the page to display correctly.**

    * Simply double-click the **`Amazon.html`** file in your file explorer. It will open automatically in your default web browser.
